  "summary": "Diff implements age-group routing/guards, restores Age Select cards, applies pastel theme tokens + non-bold defaults, restores Mascot component with animation classes and graceful fallback, and adds a StickerBoard component with slot grid + per-sticker image fallback. However, the required sticker-board background image asset is not present in the diff, and Progress hides the sticker-board entirely when no stickers are earned (conflicts with requirement to show empty slots).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "The Progress area includes a sticker-board UI that displays earned stickers placed into board slots in earned order (with empty slots visible when not yet earned).",
      "reason": "ProgressPage conditionally renders the StickerBoard only when earnedStickers.length > 0, so users with zero stickers will not see the board or empty slots.",

    {
      "requirement": "Provide the required static image asset: sticker-board-bg.dim_1200x800.png served from frontend/public/assets/generated.",
